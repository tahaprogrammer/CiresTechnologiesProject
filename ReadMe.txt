Hi, I hope you doing well.
I'm Taha.
this is the developer who made this source code.
This Source code was made in Marrakech At 02/2022, with Android Studio Platform, using Java Language.
I share 3 versions of source code in Github:
----------------------------
1. Onboarding
In this step I created "FirstUsageActivity", this activity is visible at the first time the user uses the app and after it never been displayed.
----------------------------
2. Authentification
In this step I created some files that contole the Login Page.
I created "UserAccount" java file to put the username and the password in it.
there are 3 options:
-"muser/mpassw0rd" is a valid user.
-"muser02/mpassword" is a blocked user.
-Other information is incorrect data.
----------------------------
3. News
This is the last step.
I created The "NewActivity" Activity to show the user List of News.
I used volley library as Web Services to Get All the information from the server.(As Json Data - title - imageUrl ...)
I display all the data in RecyclerView and I used ViewPager to give the user the slide pages and tabs at the top.
Finish.

Thank you, I wish you good day.
